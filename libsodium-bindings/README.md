# libsodium-bindings [![CI](https://github.com/haskell-cryptography/libsodium-bindings/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/haskell-cryptography/libsodium-bindings/actions/workflows/ci.yaml) [![made with Haskell](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20in-Haskell-%235e5086?logo=haskell&style=flat-square)](https://haskell.org)

`libsodium-bindings` exposes a set of FFI bindings from the `libsodium` library, version 1.0.18 and above.
It has no other dependency than `base`, and the documentation is strong enough to stand alone.

See [LibSodium.Bindings](https://hackage-content.haskell.org/package/libsodium-bindings/candidate/docs/LibSodium-Bindings.html) for a list of available functions.
